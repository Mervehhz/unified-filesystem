# unified-filesystem

• A cross-platform tool which combines different physical storage devices and creates a virtual drive.
• Supports encryption.
• Example: I have 2 hard drives (2TB each) and a flash drive(64GB). I define a virtual drive with this tool
and use my 2 hard drives and a flash drive for base storage. This tool creates a virtual drive (4TB +
64GB) and the operating system mounts it. Now, I can use the file explorer of the operating system and
use the virtual drive like an ordinary drive.
